# Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number 
# that has no divisors.). You can (and should!) use your answer to [Exercise 4](/exercise/2014/02/26/04-divisors.html to help you. Take 
# this opportunity to practice using functions, described below.

# This is excercise 4:
# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know
# what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no
# remainder.)

	if user_num % x == 0:
		divisors.append(x)
print divisors

# This is a different way than i've done this problem before, and it actually seems a bit easier?
