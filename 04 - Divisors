# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know
# what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no
# remainder.)

user_num = input("Please tell me a number:")

divisors = []
for x in range(1, user_num): # must start range at 0, otherwise you will be dividing by 0
	if user_num % x == 0:
		divisors.append(x)
print divisors
