# Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first
# list minus all the duplicates.

# Extras:

# Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
# Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.

a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]

no_dupes = [] # empty list for dupe-less list
def remove_dupes(given_list):
	for x in given_list:
		if x not in no_dupes: # if the element is not in the dupe-less list, add it.
			no_dupes.append(x)
	return no_dupes # return the result after it's gone through it

print remove_dupes(a) # prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
