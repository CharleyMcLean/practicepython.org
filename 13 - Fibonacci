# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. Take this
# opportunity to think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in
# the sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the
# sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
# 13, â€¦)

import math

user_num = input("How many numbers would you like to see?")

def fib(n):
	for x in range(n):
		print int((1 / math.sqrt(5)) * (((1 + math.sqrt(5))/2)**x - ((1 - math.sqrt(5))/2)**x)),
		# make the numbers integers instead of floating points
		# use the comma so the numbers are all printed on the same line
