# Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters,
# uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new
# password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

# Extra:

# Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

import random
import string

symbols = ["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")"]

num_upper = input("How many uppercase letters in your password?")
num_lower = input("How many lowercase letters in your password?")
num_dig = input("How many numbers in your password?")
num_sym = input("How many symbols in your password?")

password_list = [] # empty list that will contain the characters of the password

i = 0
while i < num_upper:
	password_list.append(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase))
	i += 1

j = 0
while j < num_lower:
	password_list.append(random.choice(string.ascii_lowercase))
	j += 1

k = 0
while k < num_dig:
	password_list.append(random.choice(string.digits))
	k += 1

l = 0
while l < num_sym:
	password_list.append(random.choice(symbols))
	l += 1

print password_list # unshuffled password list
random.shuffle(password_list) # doing this shuffles and keeps everything in the same list. 
print password_list # shuffle first, then print.  won't work otherwise

# if we want the characters printed out on a line, not in a list:
for x in password_list:
	print x, # success!
