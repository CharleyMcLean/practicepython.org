# Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters,
# uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new
# password. Include your run-time code in a main method.

# Extra:

# Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.

import random
import string

symbols = ["!", "@", "#", "$", "%", "^", "&", "*", "(", ")"]

print random.choice(string.ascii_letters)
print random.choice(string.digits)
print random.choice(symbols)

user_length = input("How long do you want your password to be?  The higher the number, the more secure it will be.")

password_list = [] # empty list that will contain the characters of the password

def password(length):
	for i in range(length / 3):
		password_list.append(random.choice(string.ascii_letters))
	for i in range(length / 3):
		password_list.append(random.choice(string.digits))
	for i in range(length / 3 + length % 3):
		password_list.append(random.choice(symbols))
	shuffled_password_list = random.shuffle(password_list)
	return shuffled_password_list


print password(user_length)
