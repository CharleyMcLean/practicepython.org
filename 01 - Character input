# character input
# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will 
# turn 100 years old.

# Extras:

# Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of 
# operations exists in Python)
# Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

from datetime import datetime # so that we will be able to call the current year

name = input("What is your name?") # for some reason having to input my name in quotes
age = input("What is your age?")

current_year = datetime.now().year # what year is it currently
year_born = current_year - age
year_hundred = year_born + 100

print name, "you will turn 100 in", year_hundred, "."

number = input("Tell me a random number.")
# number = int(number)
for i in range(number):
    print name, "you will turn 100 in", year_hundred, "."
