# Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only
# the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

def first_last(given_list):
	new_list = [given_list[0], given_list[-1]] # list including first element (0) and last element (-1)
	return new_list # return the result

print first_last(a)
