# Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to
# the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

# My name is Michele

# Then I would see the string:

# Michele is name My

# shown back to me.

orig_str = "Hello my name is Charley"

def reverse(string):
	orig_list = orig_str.split() # convert the string of words into a list of words
	rev_list = orig_list[::-1] # reverse the list
	for x in rev_list: # print out the elements of the reversed list
		print x,

reverse(orig_str) # prints Charley is name my Hello
